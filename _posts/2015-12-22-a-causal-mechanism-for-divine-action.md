# How decentralised?

**Not every
"decentralised" exchange is decentralised in ways that users would deem
important. **Exchanging currency is in
fact neither a simple or a single function, and has several aspects: 

-

coins need to be held or deposited somewhere
before they are traded, 

-

orders need to be both broadcast and matched, 

-

coins need to be exchanged between
counterparties. 

Every one of these functions can be either centralised or
decentralised for a given exchange platform.

We're very proud to say that every single one of these
functions are decentralised in the Blocknet's implementation. 

-

Unlike "decentralised" exchanges based on
coloured coins, which require traders to deposit coins at a central
intermediary in order for tokens to be issued to them, users of the Blocknet
hold coins on their local wallets.
